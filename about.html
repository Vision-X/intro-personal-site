      <h2>my story...</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Atlanta, Ga, I spent the better part of my life invloved in music. I managed a record store for 5 years, produced and DJ'd music, and worked at a few concert venues. <br> <br>Beyond music I have also worked in IT (hardware) for a few comapnies and as a contractor. I pursued a associates degree in computer science from Georiga State in 2016. <br><br> Upon completion I decided to attend a coding school that could fast track me to a career in the industry as a working developer. <br><br>As many of you know, I previously attended Turing for their front end engineering (completed Mod1) and have since decided to change programs and come to Galvanize for the Full-Stack program.</p>
